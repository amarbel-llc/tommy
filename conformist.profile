# Pins are purpose-full markl-ids (piggy RFC 0011). The POC resolver verifies

#
# `just` is just-us v0.1.0's static (pkgsStatic/musl) build, a forge release
# asset. The pin was computed from the bytes the url actually serves
# (`just explore-markl-pin <url>`), not from a reported digest. The url uses the
# public code.linenisgreat.com host: the forge's own hostname puts release
# downloads behind a login redirect, which an unattended check cannot follow.

# NOTE: the rule logic is NOT an artifact here. It is authored alongside this
# profile, so it travels inline on the stanza below and inherits this document's
# integrity — no second pin to keep correct. A data artifact remains the right
# home for a rule that is large, shared between profiles, or build-produced
# (RFC 0005 §4.4).

# LINTER STANZAS
#
# Schema per RFC 0001, plus the inline `rule` field (RFC 0005 §4.4). The runner
# passes `rule` to the tool via a file or stdin — never through a shell command
# line, which is the whole point: the filter below may contain apostrophes and
# needs no escaping.
#
# One requirement this surfaced and the first draft missed: `just` must be
# reachable by BARE NAME, so the runner must put executable artifacts on PATH.
# Otherwise every command interpolates a path for its own tool.

# WHAT WRITING THIS FILE SETTLED
#
# A linter is not a tool. `justfile-recipe-names` is a pipeline over `just`
# (fork-only), `jq` (nixpkgs), and a program that IS the rule. Delivering the
# fork's `just` delivers roughly a third of it.
#
# Both carriers for that program are REQUIRED (RFC 0005 §4.4), because they
# answer different questions about where the rule's integrity comes from:
#
#   INLINE, as above — the rule travels in this document, so whatever protects
#   the document protects the rule. No second pin to keep correct. Right for a
#   rule authored alongside its profile, which is most of them.
#
#   DATA ARTIFACT — fetched and pinned separately. Right when the rule is large,
#   shared across profiles, or build-produced, since then it does not travel in
#   the document and needs its own pin.
#
# Inlining into `command` stays REJECTED either way: the program would reach the
# tool through a shell command line, which is the quoting hazard that moving
# these filters into files removed in the first place.
#
# A stanza carrying a rule BOTH ways is an operational error, not a precedence
# question — otherwise a profile's effective rule would not be the one its
# author is reading.
#
# Consequence for v1: this profile needs no artifact-reference syntax at all,
# because its only rule is inline. That mechanism is still specified (§4.2) and
# still needed for the artifact case, but it is no longer on v1's critical path.
